Number of layers            Test Accuracy
5                     Model test accuracy: 0.323

10                    Model test accuracy: 0.355

50                    Model test accuracy: 0.581

The trend seen in this experiment shows that as the number of hidden layers increases,
the accuracy also increases. This is because adding more layers to a Nueral Networks, 
increases the capacity of the model to learn more complex patterns.
