First I ran the performed the DTW analysis with the given time staps. The following is the result for each speaker
Reference Speaker: Speaker #1
Speaker #2: DTW = 2134.6151
Speaker #3: DTW = 6704.9238
Speaker #4: DTW = 3189.5733
Speaker #5: DTW = 3345.2380

Reference Speaker: Speaker #2
Speaker #1: DTW = 2134.6151
Speaker #3: DTW = 6581.0701
Speaker #4: DTW = 3246.9998
Speaker #5: DTW = 3890.5287

Reference Speaker: Speaker #3
Speaker #1: DTW = 6704.9238
Speaker #2: DTW = 6581.0701
Speaker #4: DTW = 5595.5161
Speaker #5: DTW = 7169.1162

Reference Speaker: Speaker #4
Speaker #1: DTW = 3189.5733
Speaker #2: DTW = 3246.9998
Speaker #3: DTW = 5595.5161
Speaker #5: DTW = 4459.6315

Reference Speaker: Speaker #5
Speaker #1: DTW = 3345.2380
Speaker #2: DTW = 3890.5287
Speaker #3: DTW = 7169.1162
Speaker #4: DTW = 4459.6315

Next, I created a python code that created a cropped audio file based on inputted speaker and timestamps, so that
I could easily listen to the audio files that were being analyzed in this experiment. Here are some things noticed by 
listening to the audio files.

1. Person 1, 2, and 5 are male
2. Person 3, and 4 are female
3. Person 1, and 2 sound very similar. They maybe the same person.
4. Person 5 has the deepest voice
5. Person 4 has the highest voice
6. Not all audio files finish their sentences, some of them are cut mid sentences


By listening to the audio files and looking at the numbers, serveral conclusions can be drawn. 
1. As person 1 and 2 sound very similar, they have the lowest DTW between each other.

2. Person 5 has the lowest DTWs with the other males speakers (speaker 1 and 2). While having 
the highest DTW with person 3 who has the highest voice.

3. Interstingly, although spesker 3 has its lowest DTW with the other female speaker (speaker 4),
speaker 4 has its highest DTW with speaker 4.

4. speaker 1, 2 and 4 speak faster than the other speakers, and are cut off without being able to 
finish their sentences around the same point. This could pontentially mean that cadence in speak 
has an effect on DTW.


Next, I experimented with the length of the audio file. Only the audio time for speaker 1 and 2 were extended.
The general trend was that was described before remained the same. However, the DTW numbers significanlly increased.

Reference Speaker: Speaker #1
Speaker #2: DTW = 12354.0716
Speaker #3: DTW = 15317.9654
Speaker #4: DTW = 15043.7642
Speaker #5: DTW = 13270.3463

Reference Speaker: Speaker #5
Speaker #1: DTW = 13270.3463
Speaker #2: DTW = 11653.8567
Speaker #3: DTW = 7169.1162
Speaker #4: DTW = 4459.6315

Based on the data presented above, as the length of audio increases so does the DTW. This makes sense, as the DTW table 
gets larger, hence there would be more cost values in the path from the bottom right corner to the top left corner.

Next, I cut down the audio so that every speaker was just syaing the phrase "I can't remember". The result, is very similar
to the result of the initial time stamps. However, all the DTW values have slightly decreased.

For my final test, I chnaged the audio time stamp of speak 1 and 5 to say something other "I can't remember". The result is
shown below. (The audio length are similar to each other). NOTE: Speakers 2,3 and 4 are all saying I can't remember.

Reference Speaker: Speaker #1
Speaker #2: DTW = 11135.4714
Speaker #3: DTW = 13177.1345
Speaker #4: DTW = 12597.4455
Speaker #5: DTW = 15041.7149

Reference Speaker: Speaker #2
Speaker #1: DTW = 11135.4714
Speaker #3: DTW = 6409.4302
Speaker #4: DTW = 2641.3379
Speaker #5: DTW = 13998.8672

Reference Speaker: Speaker #3
Speaker #1: DTW = 13177.1345
Speaker #2: DTW = 6409.4302
Speaker #4: DTW = 5290.6839
Speaker #5: DTW = 15000.3118

Reference Speaker: Speaker #4
Speaker #1: DTW = 12597.4455
Speaker #2: DTW = 2641.3379
Speaker #3: DTW = 5290.6839
Speaker #5: DTW = 14578.9698

Reference Speaker: Speaker #5
Speaker #1: DTW = 15041.7149
Speaker #2: DTW = 13998.8672
Speaker #3: DTW = 15000.3118
Speaker #4: DTW = 14578.9698

Analysis:

1. The DTW of speaker 1 increased significanlly, howvever, it still shares its lowest DTW with speaker 2. 
2. Speaker has its lowest DTWs with speakers 3 and 4 who are saying the same phrase. Then sharing the 
second highest with speaker 1 who is saying something different.
3. What is said in the audio file is more important than the voice that says it.
4. In case of voice verification, DTW can still identify the correct speaker as long as all of the refrence
audio are saying same thing even if the test voice says something different. 
    a. I would assume in this scenario the DTW would focus more on other features of the speach, such as cadence
       tone, etc.
